{{-- 
    md:flex-row
This makes the two inner <div>s (left content and image) sit side by side on medium screens and up.

They're now horizontal siblings.

The left side has md:w-1/2, meaning:

On medium screens and larger, the left section takes up 50% of the container’s width.

The image div (right side) has no width specified, so it takes up the remaining space.

 flex-col-reverse
flex: Makes the container a flexbox.

col-reverse: Lays out the child items vertically but in reverse order (bottom-to-top).
So on small screens, your two items (left content and image) stack vertically, but the image appears above the text.
